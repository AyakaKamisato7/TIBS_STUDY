I support Julian Birkinshaw's view that sustaining innovation can improve existing products and technologies, so that they can quickly meet the needs of existing customers and bring stable market revenue. There is no need for companies to spend a lot of physical manpower to repeatedly build a system. Birkinshaw pointed out that people overestimate technological disruption. In fact, most innovations can be countered through new digital departments or transformations. Companies can play their own advantages and carry out digital transformation at the same time. These two points are not conflicting or contradictory. If they can be successfully combined, they can double their existing advantages.

In fact, many old companies do this. Technological development has not hit those large companies. Instead, companies will use this opportunity to make their careers go further.

Technological innovation is often not the primary reason for a company's profitability. Resources, accumulated technology and customer relationships are. Many old companies have a large customer network and resource accumulation. Through continuous innovation, the cost of R&D and promotion can be greatly reduced. Even if emerging companies have made breakthrough progress in one aspect, they cannot establish their own customer resource system in a short period of time, and whether they can make a profit is a problem.

Finally, users usually expect that the products and services they use can collect opinions and be continuously updated to bring better feedback. The birth of a product is always accompanied by sticky users. When facing competing products, they tend to stick to what they are familiar with, as long as the experience gap between the two is not particularly large. Therefore, continuous innovation helps maintain customer loyalty and market leadership. Disruptive innovation tends to focus on users in a single field in the early stage, and there is no energy and funds to take care of the main groups. The mainstream market has a low acceptance of emerging technologies, which makes it difficult for innovation to expand rapidly.

#### 《Diffusion of innovations》 by **Everett M Rogers**

第 1 章：传播要素
在本章中，罗杰斯通过解释传播的四个关键要素：创新、沟通渠道、时间和社会系统，为整个传播理论奠定了基础。他将传播定义为创新在社会系统成员之间随时间传播的过程。这里的创新是任何被个人或团体视为新事物的东西。沟通渠道——无论是通过大众媒体还是人际网络——在传播意识方面都发挥着至关重要的作用。罗杰斯还强调，采用需要时间，并且在很大程度上取决于创新如何引入社会系统，其中包括影响者、决策者和更广泛的文化背景 

In this chapter, Rogers lays the foundation for the entire diffusion theory by explaining the four key elements of diffusion: **innovation, communication channels, time, and social systems**. He defines diffusion as the process through which an innovation is communicated over time among the members of a social system. Innovation here is anything perceived as new by a person or group. Communication channels—whether through mass media or interpersonal networks—play a vital role in spreading awareness. Rogers also stresses that adoption takes time and depends heavily on how innovations are introduced into social systems, which include influencers, decision-makers, and the broader cultural context





第 3 章：传播研究的贡献和批评
本章深入探讨了传播研究的优势和劣势。罗杰斯通过解释人们如何接受新想法，讨论了创新的传播如何为农业、教育和公共卫生等领域做出贡献。他还强调了对传播研究的批评，例如它倾向于更多地关注采用者而不是非采用者，以及假设采用创新总是有益的。罗杰斯强调，了解成功和失败的采用对于改进理论及其应用至关重要

This chapter dives deeper into the **strengths and weaknesses** of diffusion research. Rogers discusses how the diffusion of innovations has contributed to fields like agriculture, education, and public health by explaining how people adopt new ideas. He also highlights criticisms of diffusion research, such as its tendency to focus more on adopters rather than non-adopters, and the assumption that adoption of innovation is always beneficial. Rogers emphasizes that understanding both successful and failed adoptions is crucial for improving the theory and its applications


第 7 章：创新性和采用者类别

在这里，罗杰斯介绍了众所周知的采用者类别：创新者、早期采用者、早期多数、晚期多数和落后者。他解释了人们接受新创新的意愿是如何变化的，每个类别都表现出不同的行为和对变化的态度。创新者是第一个接受新想法的冒险者，而落后者是最后一个，往往抵制变化。这种分类有助于理解采用曲线，并可以帮助组织根据不同人群制定战略



Here, Rogers introduces the well-known **adopter categories**: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. He explains how people’s willingness to adopt new innovations varies, with each category exhibiting different behaviors and attitudes towards change. Innovators are risk-takers who are first to embrace new ideas, while laggards are the last, often resistant to change. This categorization helps in understanding the adoption curve and can assist organizations in tailoring their strategies to different segments of the population



了创新传播的复杂性以及影响采用的因素，为分析各个领域的传播过程提供了一个全面的框架。



#### 《创新的另一面：解决执行挑战》（*The Other Side of Innovation: Solving the Execution Challenge*）一书中，V. Govindarajan 和 C. Trimble


强调了**创新执行**的重要性。作者认为，企业不仅仅需要具备产生创新想法的能力，还必须有效地执行这些创新。主要思想：

1. **创新执行和日常运营的分离**：作者指出，创新和企业的日常运营具有本质区别，因此创新项目应当与传统的业务运作相分离。常规业务追求稳定和效率，而创新则要求冒险和灵活性。将二者混合可能导致创新失败。

   **Separation of innovation execution and daily operations**: The author points out that innovation and daily operations of an enterprise are fundamentally different, so innovation projects should be separated from traditional business operations. Conventional business pursues stability and efficiency, while innovation requires risk-taking and flexibility. Mixing the two may lead to innovation failure.

2. **平衡探索与执行**：书中强调了平衡探索（新的创新想法）与执行（落实这些想法）的重要性。许多企业在生成创新想法方面表现出色，但在将这些想法付诸实施时往往遇到困难。执行创新需要不同于日常运营的流程、资源配置和管理方式。

   **Balancing Exploration and Execution**: The book emphasizes the importance of balancing exploration (new innovative ideas) and execution (implementing these ideas). Many companies excel in generating innovative ideas, but often have difficulty putting these ideas into practice. Executing innovation requires different processes, resource allocation, and management methods than daily operations.

   

3. **跨部门合作**：为了成功执行创新，Govindarajan 和 Trimble 提出了跨部门合作的必要性。创新团队需要与公司其他部门密切合作，分享资源、知识和支持，以克服实施过程中的障碍。

   **Cross-departmental collaboration**: In order to successfully execute innovation, Govindarajan and Trimble point to the need for cross-departmental collaboration. Innovation teams need to work closely with other parts of the company to share resources, knowledge, and support to overcome barriers to implementation.

4. **持续反馈与调整**：创新项目需要不断的反馈和灵活调整。作者指出，创新执行过程中不可避免地会遇到不确定性和失败，企业应当鼓励创新团队根据实际进展及时调整策略，而不是固守原有计划。

   **Continuous feedback and adjustment**: Innovation projects require continuous feedback and flexible adjustments. The author points out that uncertainty and failure are inevitable in the process of innovation execution. Companies should encourage innovation teams to adjust strategies in a timely manner based on actual progress, rather than sticking to the original plan.

   

#### 《Crossing the Chasm》by  Geoffrey Moore

**技术采纳生命周期模型**：

- Moore 在书中扩展了埃弗雷特·罗杰斯（Everett Rogers）的创新扩散理论，提出了技术产品的采纳者可以分为五类：**创新者（Innovators）**、**早期采用者（Early Adopters）**、**早期大众（Early Majority）**、**晚期大众（Late Majority）** 和 **落后者（Laggards）**。

- 这五个群体对新技术产品的接受程度不同，而其中最难的就是从早期采用者跨越到早期大众，这也是 Moore 所说的“鸿沟”。

  **Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model**:

  - In his book, Moore expanded Everett Rogers's innovation diffusion theory and proposed that technology product adopters can be divided into five categories: **Innovators**, **Early Adopters**, **Early Majority**, **Late Majority** and **Laggards**.
  - These five groups have different acceptance levels for new technology products, and the most difficult one is to cross from early adopters to early majorities, which is what Moore calls the "chasm".

**鸿沟的定义**：

- **早期采用者**是愿意尝试新技术的冒险者，他们对新产品充满热情，愿意忍受其不完善的地方。而**早期大众**则更加务实，他们需要看到明确的好处和成功案例才愿意使用新产品。

- **鸿沟**就存在于这两个群体之间，因为早期大众对风险的容忍度较低，需求更加实际。很多新技术产品无法跨越这个鸿沟，最终导致失败。

  **Definition of the Chasm**:

  - **Early adopters** are risk takers who are willing to try new technologies. They are enthusiastic about new products and willing to tolerate their imperfections. **Early majority** are more pragmatic. They need to see clear benefits and success stories before they are willing to use new products.
  - **The Chasm** exists between these two groups because the early majority has a lower tolerance for risk and more practical needs. Many new technology products cannot cross this chasm and ultimately fail.

**跨越鸿沟的策略**：

- Moore 提出了多个**跨越鸿沟**的策略，核心是**找到一个小的细分市场，成为该市场的领导者**。他建议企业在进入大众市场前，专注于某一个垂直市场，提供完整的解决方案，以满足该市场的具体需求，从而建立市场基础，逐步扩大到更广泛的市场。

- **建立可信的品牌和口碑**：在这个阶段，获得权威客户的信任并积累成功案例非常重要，因为这些客户的推荐对于说服早期大众至关重要。

  **Strategies for Crossing the Chasm**:

  - Moore proposed several **strategies for crossing the chasm**, the core of which is **find a small market segment and become the leader in that market**. He suggested that companies focus on a certain vertical market before entering the mass market, provide complete solutions to meet the specific needs of that market, thereby establishing a market foundation and gradually expanding to a wider market.
  - **Build a credible brand and word of mouth**: At this stage, it is very important to gain the trust of authoritative customers and accumulate success stories, because the recommendations of these customers are crucial to persuading the early masses.

# Week5 Financing Innovation

## 1.brief July 2017 article by Rutger Bregman writing in *The Guardian*

**观点**：马祖卡托强调政府在创新中的关键作用，反驳了传统观点即政府仅作为投资者或提供支持。她认为，政府在早期的高风险技术研发中扮演着重要角色，如iPhone中的许多关键技术（触摸屏、互联网、GPS等）都是政府资助的研究成果。文章中的评论进一步探讨了该观点与政治立场的交织，支持者认为政府应更多参与创新，而批评者担心这可能导致过度干预。

** Views **: Matsukato emphasizes the government's key role in innovation, and refutes traditional views, that is, the government only supports investors or provides support. She believes that the government plays an important role in early high -risk technology research and development, such as many key technologies (touch screens, Internet, GPS, etc.) in the iPhone is the research results funded by the government. The comments in the article further discussed the interweaving of the view and political position. Supporters believed that the government should participate more participation in innovation, and critics are worried that this may lead to excessive intervention.



## 2.Mariana Mazzucato giving a TED talk on her work

在短短14分钟内，马祖卡托阐述了“企业家国家”的概念，解释了政府如何在高风险创新的早期阶段进行投资，从而推动科技突破。她呼吁重新定义公共部门在创新生态系统中的角色，认为政府不仅仅是一个市场修正者，而是一个积极的市场创造者。

In just 14 minutes, Matsukato explained the concept of "entrepreneur country" and explained how the government invests in early stages of high -risk innovation, thereby promoting technological breakthroughs. She called for redefining the role of the public sector in the innovation ecosystem, and believes that the government is not just a market correer, but a positive market creator.

## 3.Mariana Mazzucato speaking about *The Entrepreneurial State* at The Long Now Foundation

在更长时间的演讲中，她进一步阐述了政府如何推动大规模创新，并提供了许多详细的历史案例。她认为，真正的创新需要长远的视野和稳定的资金投入，而这些往往是私人企业无法单独实现的。政府的作用不应被忽视，因为许多技术的早期发展离不开公共部门的支持。

In a longer period of time, she further explained how the government promoted large -scale innovation and provided many detailed historical cases. She believes that true innovation requires long -term vision and stable capital investment, and these are often unable to achieve private enterprises. The role of the government should not be ignored, because the early development of many technologies cannot be separated from the support of the public sector.

## 4.Stian Westlake's criticism of Matsukato

Westlake认可政府在早期技术开发中的重要性，但对马祖卡托的论点提出质疑。他认为，马祖卡托低估了市场在创新过程中的作用，并指出政府虽然可以支持基础研究，但未必能有效推动商业化。他强调了政府干预可能带来的效率问题，认为需要谨慎评估政府的角色。

Westlake recognizes the importance of the government in early technological development, but questioned Matsukato's argument. He believes that Matsukato lowered the role of the market in the process of innovation, and pointed out that although the government can support basic research, it may not be able to effectively promote commercialization. He emphasized the efficiency of government intervention, and believes that it is necessary to carefully evaluate the government's role.
