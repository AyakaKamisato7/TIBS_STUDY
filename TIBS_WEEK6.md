## 1.第一篇文章《大数据研究中的人类主体在哪里？新兴的伦理鸿沟》（作者：Jacob Metcalf 和 Kate Crawford）

**1. 大数据研究中的伦理断裂**

文章指出，数据科学和传统伦理研究之间存在日益加大的分歧。传统伦理框架通常针对生物医学研究，这使得其难以适用于大数据研究。数据科学家有时会抵触或直接拒绝遵循传统伦理规则，认为这些规则不适合现代数据科学的需求。

**1. Ethical rift in big data research**

The article points out that there is a growing divide between data science and traditional ethical research. Traditional ethical frameworks are usually targeted at biomedical research, which makes them difficult to apply to big data research. Data scientists sometimes resist or directly refuse to follow traditional ethical rules, believing that these rules are not suitable for the needs of modern data science.

**2. 公开数据的伦理风险**

一个核心问题在于，数据科学的研究通常使用“公开数据”，并认为公开数据不会对个人造成伤害。然而，作者质疑了这种假设，认为公开数据在与其他数据集结合使用时，可能会对个体和社区造成严重的隐私风险。例如，地理数据与个人信息结合可以揭示一个人的隐私活动。

- **案例：Banksy身份曝光** - 文章中提到了2016年一项研究，该研究使用地理数据来揭露匿名艺术家Banksy的身份。研究人员分析了Banksy作品的地理位置，结合选民登记和新闻报道的信息，锁定了一位特定个人。这种方法源于对恐怖分子行为的分析工具，但研究却被用于追踪Banksy的个人生活轨迹，尽管所有数据是公开的，依旧产生了隐私问题(metcalf-crawford-2016-w…)。

**2. Ethical risks of open data**

A core problem is that data science research often uses "open data" and assumes that open data will not harm individuals. However, the author questions this assumption, arguing that open data can pose serious privacy risks to individuals and communities when used in conjunction with other datasets. For example, geographic data combined with personal information can reveal a person's private activities.

- **Case: Banksy's identity exposed** - The article mentions a 2016 study that used geographic data to reveal the identity of the anonymous artist Banksy. The researchers analyzed the geographic location of Banksy's works and combined it with information from voter registration and news reports to identify a specific individual. This method originated from an analysis tool for terrorist behavior, but the study was used to track Banksy's personal life trajectory, and although all the data was public, it still raised privacy issues (metcalf-crawford-2016-w…).

**3. “数据主体性”的新概念**

由于数据科学研究不直接接触研究对象个体，其伦理问题更集中于数据的再利用、个人信息的重识别和数据驱动的歧视。文章建议引入“数据主体性”（data subjectivity）的概念，以应对新兴的数据伦理问题。这个概念承认，大数据的研究对象不仅限于个体，还包括数据所代表的社会关系和群体影响。

**3. New concept of "data subjectivity"**

Since data science research does not directly contact the individual research subjects, its ethical issues are more focused on data reuse, re-identification of personal information and data-driven discrimination. The article suggests introducing the concept of "data subjectivity" to address emerging data ethical issues. This concept recognizes that the research subjects of big data are not limited to individuals, but also include the social relations and group influences represented by the data.

**4. 传统伦理框架的局限**

传统的伦理框架强调个人干预、知情同意等生物医学领域的伦理重点，但这些难以适用于大数据。数据科学往往通过算法和数据模型从远程分析个体行为，且研究对象通常在隐私政策或服务条款中“同意”了数据使用，而实际上对具体数据用途毫不知情。
**4. Limitations of traditional ethical framework**

Traditional ethical frameworks emphasize ethical priorities in the biomedical field, such as personal intervention and informed consent, but these are difficult to apply to big data. Data science often analyzes individual behavior remotely through algorithms and data models, and research subjects usually "agree" to the use of data in privacy policies or terms of service, but in fact they are unaware of the specific use of the data.



**5. 案例分析中的伦理争议**

作者分析了几个典型的案例，说明大数据研究的伦理难题：

- **Facebook情绪感染实验** - 2014年，Facebook进行了一项实验，通过算法调整用户看到的内容，以观察情绪是否具有传染性。由于用户未被告知实验目的，此举引发了公众对隐私权和数据使用的广泛质疑。
- **地理数据与匿名** - 与Banksy案例类似，公开的地理数据通常被认为风险较小，但当多个数据集被组合使用时，可以重新识别出个体的身份并揭示其行踪。

**5. Ethical Controversy in Case Analysis**

The author analyzes several typical cases to illustrate the ethical dilemmas of big data research:

- **Facebook Emotional Contagion Experiment** - In 2014, Facebook conducted an experiment to adjust the content users see through algorithms to observe whether emotions are contagious. Since users were not informed of the purpose of the experiment, this move has aroused widespread public doubts about privacy rights and data use.

- **Geographic Data and Anonymity** - Similar to the Banksy case, public geographic data is generally considered to be less risky, but when multiple data sets are used in combination, the identity of individuals can be re-identified and their whereabouts can be revealed.



**6.大数据研究中的伦理参数重新定义**

文章呼吁在大数据研究中重新定义伦理参数，建议将“数据主体”视为社会群体，而不仅是个体，并考虑数据带来的“网络化伤害”（networked harms）。例如，数据分析可能对某一群体产生歧视性影响，这种系统性的伤害应在伦理框架中得到重视(metcalf-crawford-2016-w…)。

**6. Redefining ethical parameters in big data research**

The article calls for redefining ethical parameters in big data research, suggesting that "data subjects" should be considered as social groups rather than just individuals, and that the "networked harms" caused by data should be considered. For example, data analysis may have a discriminatory impact on a certain group, and this systemic harm should be taken seriously in the ethical framework (metcalf-crawford-2016-w…).

**7. 数据科学的未来伦理探索**

作者认为，数据科学与伦理的冲突可能无法通过现有伦理框架来解决，建议建立一种新型的“数据伦理学”，将传统的伦理约束与大数据的独特性质结合起来。

**7. Future Ethical Exploration of Data Science**

The author believes that the conflict between data science and ethics may not be resolved through the existing ethical framework, and recommends the establishment of a new type of "data ethics" that combines traditional ethical constraints with the unique nature of big data.



## 2.算法：FANG公司的生命之血》（作者：Vern McKinley

**1. 算法的无处不在和日常影响**

文章开篇指出，算法已广泛应用于人们的日常生活，虽然它们往往隐藏在我们看不见的地方，但实际上在很多普通活动中都在默默发挥作用。无论是导航、信用卡申请还是大学申请，算法都在自动化地帮助决策。这一普及带来了对算法影响的进一步探讨和理解。

**1. The ubiquity and daily impact of algorithms**

The article begins by pointing out that algorithms have been widely used in people's daily lives. Although they are often hidden in places we cannot see, they actually play a role in many ordinary activities. Whether it is navigation, credit card applications or college applications, algorithms are automatically helping decision-making. This popularity has led to further discussion and understanding of the impact of algorithms.



**2. 算法在金融行业的转变**

金融行业的算法应用是文中一个重点讨论的领域。文章通过信用审批流程的演变说明了算法的逐渐重要性。过去的信用审批依赖面对面交流以及简单的财务文件审查，而如今的算法在几毫秒内就能通过分析大量数据完成审批，这一过程不再需要人工参与。

- **案例：信用卡审批** - 作者以信用卡审批为例，描述了如今的自动化流程如何通过算法迅速分析个人数据，并依据与“相似人群”的数据进行对比，从而直接得出信用审批结果。这一自动化过程虽然高效，但也带来了透明度和公平性的问题(retrieve)。

**2. The transformation of algorithms in the financial industry**

The application of algorithms in the financial industry is a key area of discussion in this article. The article illustrates the increasing importance of algorithms through the evolution of the credit approval process. In the past, credit approval relied on face-to-face communication and simple financial document review, but now algorithms can complete approval by analyzing large amounts of data in milliseconds, and this process no longer requires human participation.

- **Case: Credit card approval** - Taking credit card approval as an example, the author describes how today's automated process quickly analyzes personal data through algorithms and compares it with the data of "similar people" to directly obtain credit approval results. Although this automated process is efficient, it also brings issues of transparency and fairness (retrieve).



**3. 隐私与身份重识别风险**

随着算法的广泛应用，隐私风险逐渐增加。作者特别强调了身份“重识别”的问题，即即使原始数据是匿名的，算法也可以通过多维度数据的组合识别出个人身份，这种现象在个人数据安全和隐私保护方面带来了严峻挑战。

- **案例：健身数据暴露风险** - 文中提到一些健身应用的匿名数据，通过算法分析，可以推断出用户的身份或位置。这说明即使是表面上“匿名”的数据，在现代算法下也可能失去匿名性，从而威胁到用户的隐私(retrieve)。

**3. Privacy and identity re-identification risks**

With the widespread application of algorithms, privacy risks are gradually increasing. The author particularly emphasizes the problem of identity "re-identification", that is, even if the original data is anonymous, the algorithm can identify the individual's identity through the combination of multi-dimensional data. This phenomenon has brought severe challenges to personal data security and privacy protection.

- **Case: Fitness data exposure risk** - The article mentions anonymous data of some fitness applications. Through algorithm analysis, the identity or location of the user can be inferred. This shows that even seemingly "anonymous" data may lose its anonymity under modern algorithms, thereby threatening the user's privacy (retrieve).



**4. FANG公司和协同过滤算法的应用**

Facebook、Amazon、Netflix和Google（FANG）等科技巨头广泛使用协同过滤算法。协同过滤通过结合个人和他人数据来生成推荐内容，例如商品推荐、影片推荐或搜索结果。作者指出，这些算法既满足了用户需求，也强化了公司对用户数据的依赖，使得数据和算法成为科技巨头的核心竞争力。

- **案例：推荐系统** - 文章分析了Amazon的“购买此商品的顾客也购买了”以及Netflix的电影推荐系统，说明协同过滤如何通过多用户数据组合优化推荐效果，但同时也加剧了隐私和透明度的争议(retrieve)。

**4. FANG companies and the application of collaborative filtering algorithms**

Collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used by technology giants such as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (FANG). Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by combining personal and other people's data, such as product recommendations, movie recommendations, or search results. The author points out that these algorithms not only meet user needs, but also strengthen the company's dependence on user data, making data and algorithms the core competitiveness of technology giants.

- **Case: Recommendation system** - The article analyzes Amazon's "Customers who bought this product also bought" and Netflix's movie recommendation system, explaining how collaborative filtering optimizes recommendation effects by combining multi-user data, but also exacerbates the controversy over privacy and transparency (retrieve).

  

**5. 算法的伦理挑战：隐私、公平与数据可靠性**

作者指出，随着算法的深入应用，隐私和公平性的问题日益突出。算法的公平性尤其受到关注，因为它们可能会基于历史数据的偏见，做出歧视性的决策。例如，算法可能会对某些族群或社会经济背景的人群做出不公平的判断。文中提到，算法在金融市场和招聘等领域的应用极易带有偏见。

- **算法偏见的风险** - 文章指出，由于算法是基于历史数据训练的，如果数据本身包含偏见，算法可能会延续甚至加剧这种偏见。例如，在信用评分系统中，特定种族或经济背景的用户可能会因为数据偏差被误判为高风险客户(retrieve)。



**5. Ethical Challenges of Algorithms: Privacy, Fairness and Data Reliability**

The author points out that with the in-depth application of algorithms, the issues of privacy and fairness have become increasingly prominent. The fairness of algorithms is of particular concern because they may make discriminatory decisions based on the bias of historical data. For example, algorithms may make unfair judgments against people of certain ethnic groups or socioeconomic backgrounds. The article mentions that the application of algorithms in areas such as financial markets and recruitment is prone to bias.

- **Risk of Algorithmic Bias** - The article points out that since algorithms are trained based on historical data, if the data itself contains bias, the algorithm may perpetuate or even exacerbate this bias. For example, in a credit scoring system, users of a certain ethnicity or economic background may be misjudged as high-risk customers (retrieve) due to data bias.



**6. 算法与用户互动的博弈论视角**

作者引用了博弈论的视角来分析用户和算法的互动关系，认为用户行为可能会受到算法的影响而改变，进而反过来影响算法的表现。这种复杂的互动模式为算法设计带来了挑战，尤其是在算法试图平衡效率和公平性时。

- **动态博弈** - 文中提出，用户的行为可能会根据算法的规则进行调整，从而影响算法的最终输出。例如，用户可能会尝试通过优化自己的数据来获得更高的信用评分或更好的推荐内容(retrieve)。

**6. Game theory perspective on algorithm-user interaction**

The author uses the perspective of game theory to analyze the interactive relationship between users and algorithms, arguing that user behavior may be affected by the algorithm and change, which in turn affects the performance of the algorithm. This complex interaction pattern poses challenges to algorithm design, especially when the algorithm tries to balance efficiency and fairness.

- **Dynamic Game** - The article suggests that user behavior may be adjusted according to the rules of the algorithm, thereby affecting the final output of the algorithm. For example, users may try to optimize their own data to obtain higher credit scores or better recommended content (retrieve).



**7. 未来的伦理算法设计**

作者呼吁在算法设计中融入更多的伦理考量，特别是隐私保护和公平性。尽管算法在提升效率上有巨大潜力，但也带来了难以忽视的社会和伦理挑战。作者建议，算法设计者应更关注算法对用户的潜在影响，并在算法中引入透明度和责任机制，以增强公众对算法的信任。

总结来说，这篇文章不仅探讨了算法在现代生活中的广泛应用，还深刻揭示了其带来的隐私、偏见和伦理问题。通过多个实例，作者强调了未来算法设计中需要引入的伦理考量，以确保算法的公平和透明。



**7. Ethical Algorithm Design in the Future**

The author calls for more ethical considerations to be incorporated into algorithm design, especially privacy protection and fairness. Although algorithms have great potential in improving efficiency, they also bring social and ethical challenges that cannot be ignored. The author suggests that algorithm designers should pay more attention to the potential impact of algorithms on users and introduce transparency and accountability mechanisms into algorithms to enhance public trust in algorithms.

In summary, this article not only explores the widespread use of algorithms in modern life, but also deeply reveals the privacy, bias and ethical issues they bring. Through multiple examples, the author emphasizes the ethical considerations that need to be introduced in future algorithm design to ensure the fairness and transparency of algorithms.



## 3.《适应或消亡？从ELSA到RRI的转变》（作者：Hub Zwart, Laurens Landeweerd和Arjan van Rooij）

**1. ELSA到RRI的转变背景**

文章首先介绍了欧洲研究资助领域从ELSA（伦理、法律与社会方面）到RRI（负责任的研究与创新）的转变。ELSA的出现旨在解决新兴科学技术中的社会和伦理问题，特别是在生命科学中。但是随着科学技术的发展，政策制定者认为有必要推进新的“负责任研究与创新”（RRI）框架，以更好地将研究与社会需求和期望相结合。

**1. Background of the transition from ELSA to RRI**

The article first introduces the transition from ELSA (Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects) to RRI (Responsible Research and Innovation) in the field of European research funding. ELSA was created to address social and ethical issues in emerging science and technology, especially in life sciences. However, as science and technology develop, policymakers believe that it is necessary to promote a new "Responsible Research and Innovation" (RRI) framework to better integrate research with social needs and expectations.



**2. RRI的政策导向和经济影响**

RRI的出现是由政策驱动的，特别是在欧盟的资助框架Horizon 2020中更为突出。与ELSA相比，RRI更加强调科学和创新活动的经济价值，例如社会经济效益、市场竞争力和就业。文章指出，RRI的这一重点转移可能会使伦理问题的关注度下降。

- **经济导向的例子** - 在欧盟的资助框架中，RRI不仅被用来解决伦理问题，还被视为促进经济增长的一种手段。这意味着企业在RRI框架下的参与度提升，研究人员和企业被鼓励为创新产品创造市场价值(s40504-014-0011-x)。

**2. Policy orientation and economic impact of RRI**

The emergence of RRI is driven by policy, especially in the EU funding framework Horizon 2020. Compared with ELSA, RRI places more emphasis on the economic value of scientific and innovative activities, such as socio-economic benefits, market competitiveness and employment. The article points out that this shift in focus of RRI may reduce the attention paid to ethical issues.

- **Example of economic orientation** - In the EU funding framework, RRI is not only used to address ethical issues, but also seen as a means to promote economic growth. This means that the participation of enterprises in the RRI framework has increased, and researchers and enterprises are encouraged to create market value for innovative products (s40504-014-0011-x).



**3. 由上而下的概念推动**

ELSA和RRI概念都是由政策制定者从上而下引入的，而非研究人员自主提出的。文章指出，这种政策驱动的术语转换反映了科学资助机构和政府希望引导研究走向特定目标的意图。这一转变被称为“转喻”，即概念的转变并非单纯的更名，而是伴随着伦理关注和价值取向的变化。

- **概念重塑** - 作者指出，ELSA的早期使用虽然带有政策色彩，但随着时间推移，研究人员逐渐将其内化并发展出独特的ELSA研究实践。然而，RRI的政策框架尚未完全形成其独特的研究方向，这使得它更倾向于经济导向而非纯粹的伦理思考(s40504-014-0011-x)。

**3. Top-down concept push**

Both ELSA and RRI concepts were introduced from the top down by policymakers, rather than proposed by researchers themselves. The article points out that this policy-driven terminology shift reflects the intention of scientific funding agencies and governments to guide research toward specific goals. This shift is called "metonymy", that is, the conceptual shift is not a simple name change, but is accompanied by changes in ethical concerns and value orientations.

- **Conceptual Reshaping** - The author points out that although the early use of ELSA was policy-colored, over time, researchers gradually internalized it and developed unique ELSA research practices. However, the policy framework of RRI has not yet fully formed its unique research direction, which makes it more inclined to economic orientation rather than pure ethical thinking (s40504-014-0011-x).

  

**4. 研究人员身份的挑战**

文章指出，RRI的转变对研究人员的身份和研究方式带来了新的挑战。ELSA为研究人员提供了一种较为明确的伦理身份，而RRI则倾向于使研究人员更靠近产业合作和经济目标，研究人员的独立性可能受到影响。

- **“转喻”的身份困境** - 在这一点上，作者提出了拉康的“转喻”概念，认为RRI框架下的研究人员身份可能会因政策的变化而变得不稳定。他们在符合资助要求的同时，可能需要牺牲部分伦理独立性，以适应经济和政策需求(s40504-014-0011-x)。

**4. Challenges to the identity of researchers**

The article points out that the transformation of RRI has brought new challenges to the identity and research methods of researchers. ELSA provides researchers with a clearer ethical identity, while RRI tends to bring researchers closer to industrial cooperation and economic goals, and the independence of researchers may be affected.

- **The identity dilemma of "metonymy"** - At this point, the author puts forward Lacan's concept of "metonymy", arguing that the identity of researchers under the RRI framework may become unstable due to policy changes. While meeting funding requirements, they may need to sacrifice some ethical independence to adapt to economic and policy needs (s40504-014-0011-x).



**5. 反思RRI与ELSA的平衡**

作者认为，RRI的实施应在吸取ELSA经验的基础上，保持对伦理问题的关注。RRI的经济导向虽然带来了更多的产业合作机会，但也可能让伦理问题被忽视。文章建议将RRI与ELSA结合起来，既推动创新又不忽略社会和伦理责任。

- **结合ELSA经验** - 作者指出，RRI不应简单地替代ELSA，而是应将ELSA的伦理关怀和RRI的经济目标整合，从而使科学技术的创新能够在伦理和经济之间找到平衡(s40504-014-0011-x)。

**5. Reflection on the balance between RRI and ELSA**

The author believes that the implementation of RRI should maintain attention to ethical issues based on the experience of ELSA. Although the economic orientation of RRI has brought more opportunities for industrial cooperation, it may also cause ethical issues to be ignored. The article suggests combining RRI with ELSA to promote innovation without neglecting social and ethical responsibilities.

- **Combined with ELSA experience** - The author points out that RRI should not simply replace ELSA, but should integrate the ethical concerns of ELSA and the economic goals of RRI, so that scientific and technological innovation can find a balance between ethics and economy (s40504-014-0011-x).



**6. 政策影响下的伦理风险**

RRI的政策性导向在推进产业合作的同时，也带来了一些伦理风险。文章强调，政策导向的创新可能更倾向于迎合经济利益，而忽略了深层次的伦理问题，特别是对于一些潜在的社会不公和技术风险的忽视。

- **政策推动的伦理风险** - 作者提出，如果RRI过度强调经济效益，可能会导致伦理风险的系统性忽略。这种倾向可能会使一些本应受到关注的伦理问题被边缘化，例如隐私、环境影响和社会不平等问题(s40504-014-0011-x)。

**6. Ethical risks under policy influence**

While promoting industrial cooperation, the policy orientation of RRI also brings some ethical risks. The article emphasizes that policy-driven innovation may be more inclined to cater to economic interests and ignore deep-seated ethical issues, especially the neglect of some potential social injustices and technological risks.

- **Ethical risks driven by policies** - The author suggests that if RRI overemphasizes economic benefits, it may lead to systematic neglect of ethical risks. This tendency may marginalize some ethical issues that should be paid attention to, such as privacy, environmental impact and social inequality (s40504-014-0011-x).



**7. 对未来的展望：开放式治理和伦理责任**

文章结尾提出，RRI未来的发展应更加开放，鼓励多方参与并强化伦理责任。特别是在技术不断发展的背景下，作者认为需要更具包容性的伦理治理机制，以平衡政策导向和社会责任。



**7.Outlook for the future: open governance and ethical responsibility**

The article concludes by suggesting that the future development of RRI should be more open, encourage multi-party participation and strengthen ethical responsibility. Especially in the context of the continuous development of technology, the author believes that a more inclusive ethical governance mechanism is needed to balance policy orientation and social responsibility.

总结来说，这篇文章详细探讨了从ELSA到RRI的转变，分析了这种转变的政策动因、经济影响和伦理挑战。作者强调，尽管RRI在政策和产业合作上带来了积极效应，但也应保持对伦理问题的关注，避免过度经济化带来的伦理风险。这一框架的转变是现代科技伦理和政策之间复杂关系的典型例子。

In summary, this article explores in detail the transition from ELSA to RRI, analyzing the policy motivations, economic impacts, and ethical challenges of this transition. The author emphasizes that although RRI has brought positive effects on policy and industry cooperation, attention should also be paid to ethical issues to avoid the ethical risks brought about by excessive economicization. This framework shift is a typical example of the complex relationship between modern science and technology ethics and policy.





## 4.《皇帝的新装：布鲁塞尔及其周边的RRI》（作者：Arie Rip）

**1. RRI的模糊性与“皇帝的新装”隐喻**

文章开篇将“负责任的研究与创新”（Responsible Research and Innovation，RRI）比作“皇帝的新装”，指出RRI这一概念具有高度的模糊性和不确定性。RRI虽然是欧盟推动的核心议题，但其定义和实施标准并不清晰，甚至连负责这一领域的专家小组也对其具体内涵存在困惑。Rip认为，这种模糊性让RRI成为一个“空洞的”概念，缺乏实际内容，但正是这种模糊性也赋予了其不同解读的空间。

- **专家小组的困惑** - 作者以自己在欧盟“科学与社会”子计划专家组的经历为例，提到小组成员对RRI的定义和实践感到不解和困惑，这反映了RRI在政策层面实施的挑战(The clothes of the empe…)。

**1. The ambiguity of RRI and the metaphor of "The Emperor's New Clothes"**

The article begins by comparing "Responsible Research and Innovation" (RRI) to "The Emperor's New Clothes", pointing out that the concept of RRI is highly ambiguous and uncertain. Although RRI is a core issue promoted by the EU, its definition and implementation standards are not clear, and even the expert group responsible for this field is confused about its specific connotation. Rip believes that this ambiguity makes RRI an "empty" concept that lacks practical content, but it is precisely this ambiguity that gives it room for different interpretations.

- **The confusion of the expert group** - The author uses his experience in the expert group of the EU's "Science and Society" sub-program as an example, mentioning that the group members were puzzled and confused about the definition and practice of RRI, which reflects the challenges of implementing RRI at the policy level (The clothes of the empe…).



**2. RRI的社会背景：社会合法性与责任转移**

Rip指出，RRI的兴起不仅源于政策推动，也反映了更广泛的社会背景。公司和政府机构逐渐意识到自己需要获得社会“合法性”才能维持运作。对于公司来说，这意味着在传统利润驱动之外，还需要展示对社会的责任感。这种趋势表明，RRI不仅是一种政策工具，也是一种社会许可（social license to operate）机制，推动企业更加负责任地创新。

- **例子：公司与公众许可** - 例如，一些公司自愿采取负责任创新的措施，以维持其与社会的信任关系，这显示了RRI在获得社会许可方面的价值(The clothes of the empe…)。

**2. Social background of RRI: social legitimacy and responsibility transfer**

Rip pointed out that the rise of RRI is not only driven by policies, but also reflects a broader social background. Companies and government agencies have gradually realized that they need to obtain social "legitimacy" to maintain operations. For companies, this means that in addition to traditional profit drivers, they also need to demonstrate a sense of responsibility to society. This trend shows that RRI is not only a policy tool, but also a social license to operate mechanism that drives companies to innovate more responsibly.

- **Example: Company and public license** - For example, some companies voluntarily take measures for responsible innovation to maintain their trust relationship with society, which shows the value of RRI in obtaining social license (The clothes of the empe…).



**3. RRI的开放性与政治性**

作者认为，RRI在某种程度上充当了一个“伞式术语”，覆盖了多个主题，并为不同利益相关者提供了合作空间。这种开放性使得RRI可以被不同组织、企业和研究机构以各自的方式解读和应用，成为利益平衡和互动的场所。然而，这种开放性也使RRI容易受到政治操控，成为政策制定者和企业用以追求特定目标的工具。

- **多样化解读的现象** - Rip指出，RRI被不同利益相关方视为各自利益的表达手段，可能会导致RRI的实施偏离其初衷(The clothes of the empe…)。

**3. Openness and politics of RRI**

The author believes that RRI, to some extent, acts as an "umbrella term" that covers multiple topics and provides a space for cooperation among different stakeholders. This openness allows RRI to be interpreted and applied by different organizations, enterprises and research institutions in their own ways, becoming a place for balancing interests and interacting with each other. However, this openness also makes RRI vulnerable to political manipulation and a tool for policymakers and enterprises to pursue specific goals.

- **The phenomenon of diverse interpretations** - Rip pointed out that RRI is regarded by different stakeholders as a means of expressing their respective interests, which may cause the implementation of RRI to deviate from its original intention (The clothes of the empe…).



**4. RRI的政策和学术分歧**

文章进一步分析了RRI在政策层面和学术领域之间的分歧。学术界更倾向于将RRI视为一种“理想型”框架，致力于推动深层次的社会责任变革。然而，在政策层面，RRI往往被简化为一系列具体的行动计划（例如性别平等、公开获取等），这些行动虽然重要，但缺乏系统性的变革力。Rip认为，这种分歧可能会影响RRI的长期发展。

- **具体行动与系统性变革的差异** - RRI在政策中的体现通常是通过“关键主题”来推动，例如性别平等和伦理审查，这些虽然重要，但无法实现深层次的制度转变(The clothes of the empe…)。

**4. Policy and academic differences on RRI**

The article further analyzes the differences between RRI at the policy level and in the academic field. The academic community tends to view RRI as an "ideal" framework that is committed to promoting deep social responsibility changes. However, at the policy level, RRI is often simplified into a series of specific action plans (such as gender equality, open access, etc.), which are important but lack systemic transformation. Rip believes that this disagreement may affect the long-term development of RRI.

- **Differences between specific actions and systemic changes** - The manifestation of RRI in policy is usually promoted through "key themes", such as gender equality and ethical review, which are important but cannot achieve deep institutional transformation (The clothes of the empe…).



**5. RRI与技术评估的关联**

作者还将RRI与技术评估（Technology Assessment, TA）进行了比较。技术评估已有40多年的历史，被视为一种更为成熟的社会责任方法。Rip认为，RRI应借鉴技术评估的经验，在探索社会责任和创新的结合方面寻找更具反思性和制度化的方式。RRI与技术评估的交叉应用可能为未来的负责任创新提供有力支持。

- **技术评估的借鉴** - RRI可以从技术评估的发展中学习，将其作为推动反思性变革的手段，从而更好地应对社会和伦理挑战(The clothes of the empe…)。

**5. The connection between RRI and technology assessment**

The author also compares RRI with Technology Assessment (TA). Technology assessment has a history of more than 40 years and is regarded as a more mature social responsibility method. Rip believes that RRI should learn from the experience of technology assessment and find a more reflective and institutionalized way to explore the combination of social responsibility and innovation. The cross-application of RRI and technology assessment may provide strong support for responsible innovation in the future.

- **References from technology assessment** - RRI can learn from the development of technology assessment and use it as a means to promote reflective change to better respond to social and ethical challenges (The clothes of the empe…).



**6. RRI的未来：从概念到实际操作**

Rip认为，尽管RRI目前具有模糊性和不确定性，但其作为“皇帝的新装”依然可以随着时间推移逐渐变得真实。作者引用了Thomas定理：“如果人们认为某种情况是真实的，那么其后果就会是真实的。”这种思维模式可能使RRI随着越来越多的参与者和活动而逐渐变得具体化，并最终形成某种共识。

- **从话语到现实的转变** - RRI虽然目前还处于概念构建的阶段，但其在政策层面的推动和实际项目的实施可能最终使其成为实际的社会变革工具(The clothes of the empe…)。

**6. The future of RRI: from concept to actual operation**

Rip believes that despite the current ambiguity and uncertainty of RRI, it can still become real over time as the "Emperor's new clothes". The author quoted Thomas's theorem: "If people think something is real, then its consequences will be real." This mode of thinking may make RRI gradually concrete with more and more participants and activities, and eventually form a certain consensus.

- **Transition from discourse to reality** - Although RRI is still in the stage of conceptual construction, its promotion at the policy level and the implementation of actual projects may eventually make it a practical tool for social change (The clothes of the empe…).



**7. 反思与展望：应对RRI的挑战**

文章最后提出，RRI的未来取决于其能否在多方利益之间找到平衡，并在保持开放性的同时逐渐确立具体的执行机制。作者呼吁政策制定者和学术界共同努力，以确保RRI在未来的实施过程中既能适应多样化的需求，也不失去伦理责任的核心价值。

总结来说，这篇文章通过“皇帝的新装”的比喻深入剖析了RRI概念的模糊性和挑战。作者认为，RRI在政策和学术之间的定位模糊，既是其适应性强的优势，也是其缺乏实际内容的风险。尽管如此，RRI仍然可以在不同领域中找到其应用的切入点，通过多方协作逐渐将概念转化为实际行动。



**7. Reflection and Outlook: Meeting the Challenges of RRI**

The article concludes by proposing that the future of RRI depends on whether it can find a balance between the interests of multiple parties and gradually establish a specific implementation mechanism while maintaining openness. The author calls on policymakers and academia to work together to ensure that RRI can adapt to diverse needs in the future implementation process without losing the core value of ethical responsibility.

In summary, this article deeply analyzes the ambiguity and challenges of the RRI concept through the metaphor of "the emperor's new clothes". The author believes that the ambiguity of RRI's positioning between policy and academia is both its advantage of strong adaptability and its risk of lacking practical content. Despite this, RRI can still find its entry point for application in different fields and gradually transform the concept into practical action through multi-party collaboration.



## 5.《产业中的RRI：将RRI话语转化为私人领域》（作者：Bernd Stahl）

**1. RRI的起源与适用范围**

文章开篇指出，负责任的研究与创新（RRI）概念最初源于公共资助的研究领域，旨在确保科学技术的开发能够满足公众利益。然而，文章指出，尽管RRI在公共领域中得到广泛推广，但大多数研究和创新活动实际上发生在私人公司中，特别是信息通信技术（ICT）领域。作者提出了一个关键问题：RRI在这种以盈利为目的的私营部门是否具有可行性？

- **公共与私人研究的差异** - 公共研究主要面向基础研究和概念开发，而私人部门则侧重于市场导向的创新。这种不同的研究目标为RRI在私人领域的推广带来了挑战(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**1. Origin and scope of RRI**

The article begins by stating that the concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI) originated from the field of publicly funded research, aiming to ensure that the development of science and technology serves the public interest. However, the article points out that although RRI is widely promoted in the public sector, most research and innovation activities actually take place in private companies, especially in the field of information and communication technology (ICT). The author raises a key question: Is RRI feasible in this for-profit private sector?

- **Differences between public and private research** - Public research is mainly oriented towards basic research and concept development, while the private sector focuses on market-oriented innovation. This different research goal poses a challenge to the promotion of RRI in the private sector (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).

**2. 公共与私人研究活动的边界模糊**

文章讨论了公共和私营部门在研究和创新活动中角色的模糊性。例如，大学等公共机构有时也会涉足商业化活动，试图将研究成果推向市场；而一些私人公司则会参与基础研究项目。因此，作者认为，仅通过资助来源来区分公共和私人活动已不再合适。

- **协作项目的例子** - 许多项目都包含公共和私营部门的合作，如大学和企业在技术研发中的联合，这进一步模糊了两者之间的界限(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**2. Blurred boundaries between public and private research activities**

The article discusses the ambiguity of the roles of the public and private sectors in research and innovation activities. For example, public institutions such as universities sometimes engage in commercialization activities, trying to bring research results to the market; while some private companies participate in basic research projects. Therefore, the author believes that it is no longer appropriate to distinguish between public and private activities only by funding sources.

- **Examples of collaborative projects** - Many projects involve cooperation between the public and private sectors, such as the combination of universities and enterprises in technology research and development, which further blurs the boundaries between the two (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).



**3. RRI在企业中的挑战：利润与伦理的平衡**

作者指出，RRI要在企业中有效实施，必须与企业的核心驱动力（即利润）相兼容。由于RRI活动（如公共参与、伦理审查等）通常会产生额外成本且不一定带来直接的财务回报，这对企业而言是一项重要的挑战。文章强调，如果RRI的实施违反了企业的利润目标，那么很难获得企业的真正支持。

- **成本与收益的权衡** - 作者指出，RRI的许多活动需要投入资源，而其带来的财务收益往往难以量化，这对强调效率和盈利的企业来说是一项重大挑战(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**3. Challenges of RRI in Enterprises: Balance between Profit and Ethics**

The author points out that for RRI to be effectively implemented in enterprises, it must be compatible with the core driving force of the enterprise (i.e., profit). This is an important challenge for enterprises because RRI activities (such as public participation, ethical review, etc.) usually incur additional costs and do not necessarily bring direct financial returns. The article emphasizes that if the implementation of RRI violates the profit goals of the enterprise, it will be difficult to obtain real support from the enterprise.

- **Trade-off between Cost and Benefit** - The author points out that many RRI activities require resource investment, and the financial benefits they bring are often difficult to quantify, which is a major challenge for enterprises that emphasize efficiency and profitability (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).

**4. 企业采纳RRI的潜在动机：风险管理与社会许可**

尽管RRI可能增加成本，但作者认为，它也可以作为一种广泛的风险管理工具。通过与公众和利益相关者建立良好的关系，RRI可以帮助公司减少潜在的用户抵制风险。同时，RRI还能为公司提供一种社会许可，使其在公众面前展示自己的责任感，从而获得更大的社会支持。

- **社会许可的例子** - 公司通过RRI活动可以赢得公众的信任，例如在产品设计中考虑伦理问题，从而减少用户反感和拒绝的可能性(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**4. Potential motivations for companies to adopt RRI: risk management and social license**

Although RRI may increase costs, the authors believe that it can also be used as a broad risk management tool. By building good relationships with the public and stakeholders, RRI can help companies reduce the risk of potential user resistance. At the same time, RRI can also provide companies with a social license to demonstrate their sense of responsibility in front of the public, thereby gaining greater social support.

- **Example of social license** - Companies can win public trust through RRI activities, such as considering ethical issues in product design, thereby reducing the possibility of user disgust and rejection (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).

**5. 将RRI转化为企业语言：与CSR的对接**

为了促进RRI在企业中的应用，文章提出将RRI与企业熟悉的“企业社会责任”（CSR）概念对接的策略。通过这种方式，RRI可以更自然地融入企业文化和商业语言，使企业管理者更容易理解和接受这一框架。作者认为，RRI的伦理和责任性原则可以与CSR的目标兼容，从而帮助公司在追求盈利的同时履行社会责任。

- **CSR对接的例子** - 企业更容易接受和实施类似CSR的RRI措施，因为CSR已被广泛接受，且在许多企业中已成为成熟的实践模式(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**5. Translating RRI into corporate language: docking with CSR**

In order to promote the application of RRI in enterprises, the article proposes a strategy to dock RRI with the concept of "corporate social responsibility" (CSR) that enterprises are familiar with. In this way, RRI can be more naturally integrated into corporate culture and business language, making it easier for corporate managers to understand and accept this framework. The author believes that the ethical and responsibility principles of RRI can be compatible with the goals of CSR, thereby helping companies to fulfill their social responsibilities while pursuing profits.

- **Example of CSR docking** - Enterprises are more likely to accept and implement RRI measures similar to CSR because CSR has been widely accepted and has become a mature practice model in many enterprises (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).

**6. 实现RRI在企业中的价值：提高产品与服务质量**

作者指出，RRI在企业中的应用不仅是为了满足外部的伦理要求，还可能帮助企业设计更具吸引力的产品和服务。通过在创新活动中引入多方观点，RRI可以使企业更全面地理解用户需求，从而改进产品设计和用户体验。

- **产品改进的例子** - 作者提到，通过RRI的多方参与，企业可以获得不同利益相关者的反馈，从而更好地满足市场需求并提高产品的接受度(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**6. Realizing the value of RRI in enterprises: improving product and service quality**

The author points out that the application of RRI in enterprises is not only to meet external ethical requirements, but also to help enterprises design more attractive products and services. By introducing multiple perspectives in innovation activities, RRI can enable enterprises to understand user needs more comprehensively, thereby improving product design and user experience.

- **Product improvement example** - The author mentioned that through the multi-party participation of RRI, enterprises can obtain feedback from different stakeholders, thereby better meeting market needs and improving product acceptance (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).

  

**7. 推动RRI在企业中的长期发展**

作者认为，RRI要在企业中持续发展，需要建立能够与企业长期利益相一致的实施框架，例如将其纳入公司战略和风险管理系统中。同时，推动RRI在私营部门的制度化，可能需要政府、行业协会和学术界的共同支持，以确保RRI能够真正渗透到商业运营中。

- **制度化的展望** - RRI的有效推广需要将其纳入企业的长远战略，使其成为公司管理和风险控制的组成部分，从而实现持续的伦理和社会价值(1-s2.0-S251585622030030…)。

**7. Promote the long-term development of RRI in enterprises**

The author believes that for RRI to develop continuously in enterprises, it is necessary to establish an implementation framework that is consistent with the long-term interests of enterprises, such as incorporating it into corporate strategy and risk management systems. At the same time, promoting the institutionalization of RRI in the private sector may require the joint support of the government, industry associations and academia to ensure that RRI can truly penetrate into business operations.

- **Prospects for institutionalization** - The effective promotion of RRI needs to be incorporated into the long-term strategy of enterprises, making it an integral part of corporate management and risk control, so as to achieve continuous ethical and social values (1-s2.0-S251585622030030…).



总结来说，本文深入探讨了将RRI引入企业的挑战和策略。作者指出，RRI在企业中的推广需与利润驱动目标相适应，同时需要通过与CSR的对接来实现企业的接受。通过在产品和服务设计中融入社会责任和多方参与，RRI不仅可以减少企业的社会风险，还能提高产品质量，从而为企业带来长期的市场优势。这为如何在私营部门有效实施RRI提供了一个实用的框架。

In summary, this article explores the challenges and strategies of introducing RRI into enterprises. The author points out that the promotion of RRI in enterprises needs to be consistent with profit-driven goals, and at the same time, it needs to be connected with CSR to achieve corporate acceptance. By incorporating social responsibility and multi-stakeholder participation in product and service design, RRI can not only reduce corporate social risks, but also improve product quality, thereby bringing long-term market advantages to enterprises. This provides a practical framework for how to effectively implement RRI in the private sector.



## 6.负责任的创新与负责任的研究与创新》（作者：Richard Owen 和 Mario Pansera）

**1. 负责任创新（RI）与负责任研究与创新（RRI）概念的起源与发展**

文章首先介绍了RI和RRI这两个紧密相关的概念的起源，指出它们分别来自学术界和政策制定机构。RI更多源于学术界的讨论，重点是推动对科学和创新的社会责任意识，而RRI则主要由欧洲委员会（EC）推动，意在将研究与创新与社会需求和期望相结合。作者强调，尽管两者有共同之处，但其发展路径和侧重点各有不同。

- **政策推动与学术研究的分歧** - RRI主要源自欧盟政策，强调科技的社会参与，而RI则更关注科学界内部的反思和责任(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**1. The origin and development of the concepts of responsible innovation (RI) and responsible research and innovation (RRI)**

The article first introduces the origins of the two closely related concepts of RI and RRI, pointing out that they come from academia and policy-making institutions respectively. RI is more derived from academic discussions, focusing on promoting social responsibility awareness of science and innovation, while RRI is mainly promoted by the European Commission (EC) and aims to combine research and innovation with social needs and expectations. The author emphasizes that although the two have similarities, their development paths and focuses are different.

- **Divergence between policy promotion and academic research** - RRI is mainly derived from EU policies, emphasizing the social participation of science and technology, while RI is more focused on reflection and responsibility within the scientific community (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**2. RRI的关键主题与政策框架**

欧盟的RRI政策主要通过几个“关键主题”（RRI keys）来推广，包括性别平等、开放获取、伦理审查、公众参与和科学教育。文章指出，虽然这些主题确实重要，但它们是相对孤立的，并未构成系统的变革力量。此外，这些关键主题的政策性质较强，缺乏与创新体系的深度融合，可能限制RRI在应对复杂社会挑战方面的作用。

- **RRI关键主题的局限** - 作者认为，欧盟提出的“关键主题”虽然为RRI提供了政策支持，但未能推动全面的系统转型(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**2. Key themes and policy framework of RRI**

The EU's RRI policy is mainly promoted through several "key themes" (RRI keys), including gender equality, open access, ethical review, public participation and scientific education. The article points out that although these themes are indeed important, they are relatively isolated and do not constitute a systemic force for change. In addition, these key themes have a strong policy nature and lack deep integration with the innovation system, which may limit the role of RRI in addressing complex social challenges.

- **Limitations of RRI key themes** - The author believes that although the "key themes" proposed by the EU provide policy support for RRI, they fail to promote comprehensive system transformation (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**3. RI的学术性与系统性转变的追求**

与RRI相比，RI更注重推动深层次的制度变革，希望科学和创新更加具备前瞻性、反思性和包容性。RI的倡导者主张创新体系应更关注社会的长远利益和多样化需求，这种理想更倾向于对现有创新模式的批判和改进，而不仅仅是增加特定的政策措施。

- **制度转型的例子** - 作者指出，RI不仅要响应当下的社会需求，还应考虑未来的长期影响，例如应对气候变化和社会不平等等全球性挑战(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**3. The academic and systematic transformation of RI**

Compared with RRI, RI focuses more on promoting deep institutional changes, hoping that science and innovation will be more forward-looking, reflective and inclusive. RI advocates advocate that the innovation system should pay more attention to the long-term interests and diversified needs of society. This ideal is more inclined to criticize and improve the existing innovation model rather than just adding specific policy measures.

- **Example of institutional transformation** - The author points out that RI should not only respond to current social needs, but also consider long-term impacts in the future, such as responding to global challenges such as climate change and social inequality (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**4. RI与RRI的区别与交叉**

虽然RI和RRI在目标上有部分重叠，但作者认为，两者的具体方法和关注点有很大不同。RRI偏向政策的直接应用，目标是通过特定措施确保科技成果符合公共利益；而RI则强调科技和创新的内在责任，推动科学家和创新者对未来可能产生的社会后果承担责任。这种区别导致了RI在实践中遇到更多的学术讨论，而RRI在政策领域的应用更广泛。

- **RI的前瞻性与RRI的政策性** - RI强调责任的前瞻性，推动创新者考虑未来的伦理影响，而RRI则更具政策性，偏重短期的社会利益(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**4. Differences and overlaps between RI and RRI**

Although RI and RRI have some overlap in their goals, the author believes that their specific methods and focuses are very different. RRI tends to be directly applied to policies, with the goal of ensuring that scientific and technological achievements are in the public interest through specific measures; while RI emphasizes the inherent responsibility of science and technology and innovation, and encourages scientists and innovators to take responsibility for possible social consequences in the future. This difference has led to more academic discussions on RI in practice, while RRI is more widely used in the policy field.

- **The forward-looking nature of RI and the policy nature of RRI** - RI emphasizes the forward-looking nature of responsibility, and encourages innovators to consider future ethical impacts, while RRI is more policy-oriented and focuses on short-term social benefits (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**5. RI的挑战与抗拒**

RI的理想虽然具有吸引力，但在实践中遇到了许多挑战，尤其是在商业和政府主导的经济增长议程中，RI的伦理和社会考量往往与盈利目标和政治利益产生冲突。作者指出，RI在推行过程中常受到来自既得利益的抵制，特别是在涉及改变企业行为或重新定义创新标准时，阻力尤为明显。

- **经济增长与社会责任的冲突** - 作者提到，在以经济增长为核心的政策框架下，RI的社会和伦理责任往往受到忽视，尤其是在涉及企业盈利的领域(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**5. Challenges and resistance to RI**

Although the ideal of RI is attractive, it has encountered many challenges in practice, especially in the economic growth agenda led by business and government, where the ethical and social considerations of RI often conflict with profit goals and political interests. The author points out that RI is often resisted by vested interests during its implementation, especially when it involves changing corporate behavior or redefining innovation standards.

- **Conflict between economic growth and social responsibility** - The author mentions that under the policy framework centered on economic growth, the social and ethical responsibilities of RI are often neglected, especially in areas involving corporate profits (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**6. RI与创新体系的整合难题**

文章还讨论了RI与现有创新体系的整合难题。作者认为，当前的创新体系多围绕技术进步和市场需求展开，而缺乏对社会和伦理责任的系统性考量。要实现RI的理想，需要重新配置创新体系中的知识流动和角色分配，使创新更加具有包容性和社会责任感。

- **创新体系的重新配置** - 作者提出，要实现RI的目标，创新体系需调整知识流动和角色，以更好地满足社会需求和应对复杂的全球性挑战(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**6. The integration problem of RI and innovation system**

The article also discusses the integration problem of RI and existing innovation system. The author believes that the current innovation system is mainly centered around technological progress and market demand, but lacks systematic consideration of social and ethical responsibilities. To achieve the ideal of RI, it is necessary to reconfigure the knowledge flow and role allocation in the innovation system to make innovation more inclusive and socially responsible.

- **Reconfiguration of innovation system** - The author proposes that to achieve the goal of RI, the innovation system needs to adjust the knowledge flow and roles to better meet social needs and respond to complex global challenges (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



**7. RRI和RI的未来展望**

在结尾部分，作者提出了对RRI和RI未来发展的展望。尽管两者在政策和学术界遇到不同的挑战，但它们的存在反映了社会对负责任创新的迫切需求。文章建议，未来的RRI和RI应寻求更深层次的合作，通过更具系统性的机制来推动科学与社会的互动。特别是在应对社会重大挑战（如环境、健康和不平等）方面，RI和RRI应互为补充。

- **社会互动的机制构建** - 作者认为，通过构建更具反思性和前瞻性的创新框架，RI和RRI可以在重大社会挑战中发挥更大作用(9781784715939-Handbooko…)。

**7. Future prospects of RRI and RI**

In the final part, the author proposes a prospect for the future development of RRI and RI. Although the two encounter different challenges in policy and academia, their existence reflects the urgent need for responsible innovation in society. The article suggests that future RRI and RI should seek deeper cooperation and promote the interaction between science and society through more systematic mechanisms. In particular, RI and RRI should complement each other in addressing major social challenges (such as the environment, health and inequality).

- **Mechanism construction of social interaction** - The author believes that by building a more reflective and forward-looking innovation framework, RI and RRI can play a greater role in major social challenges (9781784715939-Handbooko…).



总结来说，这篇文章详细比较了RI和RRI的起源、发展路径和应用领域。作者指出，RRI的政策驱动特性使其更容易在公共领域推广，但在系统性变革上显得不足，而RI则强调深层次的制度和社会责任意识，虽然具有挑战性但更具前瞻性。文章呼吁两者相互借鉴，构建更具包容性和责任感的创新体

In summary, this article compares the origins, development paths, and application areas of RI and RRI in detail. The author points out that the policy-driven nature of RRI makes it easier to promote in the public sector, but it is insufficient in terms of systemic change, while RI emphasizes deep-level institutional and social responsibility awareness, which is challenging but more forward-looking. The article calls for mutual learning between the two to build a more inclusive and responsible innovation system to meet future social and ethical challenges.系，以应对未来的社会和伦理挑战。
